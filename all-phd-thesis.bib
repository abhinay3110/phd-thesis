abstract={With the rapid development of artificial intelligence have come concerns about how machines will make moral decisions, and the major challenge of quantifying societal expectations about the ethical principles that should guide machine behaviour. To address this challenge, we deployed the Moral Machine, an online experimental platform designed to explore the moral dilemmas faced by autonomous vehicles. This platform gathered 40 million decisions in ten languages from millions of people in 233 countries and territories. Here we describe the results of this experiment. First, we summarize global moral preferences. Second, we document individual variations in preferences, based on respondents' demographics. Third, we report cross-cultural ethical variation, and uncover three major clusters of countries. Fourth, we show that these differences correlate with modern institutions and deep cultural traits. We discuss how these preferences can contribute to developing global, socially acceptable principles for machine ethics. All data used in this article are publicly available.},

@inproceedings{Stentz1994,
	abstract = {The task of planning trajectories for a mobile robot has received considerable attention in the research literature. Most of the work assumes the robot has a complete and accurate model of its environment before it begins to move; less attention has been paid to the problem of partially known environments. This situation occurs for an exploratory robot or one that must move to a goal location without the benefit of a floorplan or terrain map. Existing approaches plan an initial path based on known information and then modify the plan locally or replan the entire path as the robot discovers obstacles with its sensors, sacrificing optimality or computational efficiency respectively. This paper introduces a new algorithm, D, capable of planning paths in unknown, partially known, and changing environments in an efficient, optimal, and complete manner.},

@article{Bohren2008,
	abstract = {This paper describes "Little Ben," an autonomous ground vehicle constructed by the Ben Franklin Racing Team for the 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge in under a year and for less than {\$}250,000. The sensing, planning, navigation, and actuation systems for Little Ben were carefully designed to meet the performance demands required of an autonomous vehicle traveling in an uncertain urban environment. We incorporated an array of a global positioning system (GPS)/inertial navigation system, LIDARs, and stereo cameras to provide timely information about the surrounding environment at the appropriate ranges. This sensor information was integrated into a dynamic map that could robustly handle GPS dropouts and errors. Our planning algorithms consisted of a high-level mission planner that used information from the provided route network definition and mission data files to select routes, whereas the lower level planner used the latest dynamic map information to optimize a feasible trajectory to the next waypoint. The vehicle was actuated by a cost-based controller that efficiently handled steering, throttle, and braking maneuvers in both forward and reverse directions. Our software modules were integrated within a hierarchical architecture that allowed rapid development and testing of the system performance. The resulting vehicle was one of six to successfully finish the Urban Challenge. {\textcopyright} 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

@article{Bacha2008,
	abstract = {The DARPA Urban Challenge required robotic vehicles to travel more than 90 km through an urban environment without human intervention and included situations such as stop intersections, traffic merges, parking, and roadblocks. Team VictorTango separated the problem into three parts: base vehicle, perception, and planning. A Ford Escape outfitted with a custom drive-by-wire system and computers formed the basis for Odin. Perception used laser scanners, global positioning system, and a priori knowledge to identify obstacles, cars, and roads. Planning relied on a hybrid deliberative/reactive architecture toanalyze the situation, select the appropriate behavior, and plan a safe path. All vehicle modules communicated using the JAUS (Joint Architecture for Unmanned Systems) standard. The performance of these components in the Urban Challenge is discussed and successes noted. The result of VictorTango's work was successful completion of the Urban Challenge and a third-place finish. {\textcopyright} 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

After describing the main challenges imposed and the major hardware components, we outline the underlying software structure and focus on selected algorithms. Environmental perception mainly relies on a recent laser scanner that delivers both range and reflectivity measurements. Whereas range measurements are used to provide three-dimensional scene geometry, measuring reflectivity allows for robust lane marker detection. Mission and maneuver planning is conducted using a hierarchical state machine that generates behavior in accordance with California traffic laws. We conclude with a report of the results achieved during the competition. {\textcopyright} 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {Boss is an autonomous vehicle that uses on-board sensors (global positioning system, lasers, radars, and cameras) to track other vehicles, detect static obstacles, and localize itself relative to a road model. A three-layer planning system combines mission, behavioral, and motion planning to drive in urban environments. The mission planning layer considers which street to take to achieve a mission goal. The behavioral layer determines when to change lanes and precedence at intersections and performs error recovery maneuvers. The motion planning layer selects actions to avoid obstacles while making progress toward local goals. The system was developed from the ground up to address the requirements of the DARPA Urban Challenge using a spiral system development process with a heavy emphasis on regular, regressive system testing. During the National Qualification Event and the 85-km Urban Challenge Final Event, Boss demonstrated some of its capabilities, qualifying first and winning the challenge. {\textcopyright} 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

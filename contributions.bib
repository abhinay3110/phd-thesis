	abstract = {The problem of behaviour prediction for linear parameter-varying systems is considered in the interval framework. It is assumed that the system is subject to uncertain inputs and the vector of scheduling parameters is unmeasurable, but all uncertainties take values in a given admissible set. Then an interval predictor is designed and its stability is guaranteed applying Lyapunov function with a novel structure. The conditions of stability are formulated in the form of linear matrix inequalities. Efficiency of the theoretical results is demonstrated in the application to safe motion planning for autonomous vehicles.},

	abstract="We consider the problem of online planning in a Markov Decision Process when given only access to a generative model, restricted to open-loop policies - i.e. sequences of actions - and under budget constraint. In this setting, the Open-Loop Optimistic Planning (OLOP) algorithm enjoys good theoretical guarantees but is overly conservative in practice, as we show in numerical experiments. We propose a modified version of the algorithm with tighter upper-confidence bounds, KL-OLOP, that leads to better practical performances while retaining the sample complexity bound. Finally, we propose an efficient implementation that significantly improves the time complexity of both algorithms.",

@inproceedings{Leurent2020robust,
	abstract = {We consider the problem of stabilization of a linear system, under state and control constraints, and subject to bounded disturbances and unknown parameters in the state matrix. First, using a simple least square solution and available noisy measurements, the set of admissible values for parameters is evaluated. Second, for the estimated set of parameter values and the corresponding linear interval model of the system, two interval predictors are recalled and an unconstrained stabilizing control is designed that uses the predicted intervals. Third, to guarantee the robust constraint satisfaction, a model predictive control algorithm is developed, which is based on solution of an optimization problem posed for the interval predictor. The conditions for recursive feasibility and asymptotic performance are established. Efficiency of the proposed control framework is illustrated by numeric simulations.},

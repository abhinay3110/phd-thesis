	abstract={A dynamic sliding mode controller design method is proposed for multiple input-output systems with additive uncertainties. A previous result on the stability of triangular systems is generalised to the case of uniform ultimate boundedness of controlled triangular systems. This is used to prove the stability of the overall closed-loop system. The uncertain system with appropriately chosen sliding mode control is shown to be ultimately bounded if the zero dynamics of the nominal system are uniformly asymptotically (exponentially) stable. The design method is demonstrated with two examples.},

The proposed approach can deal with both input and output constraints, as well as measurement noise and output disturbances. The adaptive controller consists of an iterative set membership identification algorithm, that provides a set of candidate plant models at each time step, and a model predictive controller, that enforces input and output constraints for all the plants inside the model set. The algorithm relies only on the solution of standard convex optimization problems that are guaranteed to be recursively feasible. The experimental results obtained by applying the proposed controller to a quad-tank testbed are presented.},

  abstract = 	 {Thompson sampling (TS) is an effective approach to trade off exploration and exploration in reinforcement learning. Despite its empirical success and recent advances, its theoretical analysis is often limited to the Bayesian setting, finite state-action spaces, or finite-horizon problems. In this paper, we study an instance of TS in the challenging setting of the infinite-horizon linear quadratic (LQ) control, which models problems with continuous state-action variables, linear dynamics, and quadratic cost. In particular, we analyze the regret in the frequentist sense (i.e., for a fixed unknown environment) in one-dimensional systems. We derive the first $O(\sqrt{T})$ frequentist regret bound for this problem, thus significantly improving the $O(T^{2/3})$ bound of Abeille & Lazaric (2017) and matching the frequentist performance derived by Abbasi-Yadkori & Szepesvári (2011) for an optimistic approach and the Bayesian result Ouyang et al. (2017) We obtain this result by developing a novel bound on the regret due to policy switches, which holds for LQ systems of any dimensionality and it allows updating the parameters and the policy at each step, thus overcoming previous limitations due to lazy updates. Finally, we report numerical simulations supporting the conjecture that our result extends to multi-dimensional systems.}

	year={2019},

	day={05},
	abstract={This paper addresses the optimal control problem known as the linear quadratic regulator in the case when the dynamics are unknown. We propose a multistage procedure, called Coarse-ID control, that estimates a model from a few experimental trials, estimates the error in that model with respect to the truth, and then designs a controller using both the model and uncertainty estimate. Our technique uses contemporary tools from random matrix theory to bound the error in the estimation procedure. We also employ a recently developed approach to control synthesis called System Level Synthesis that enables robust control design by solving a quasi-convex optimization problem. We provide end-to-end bounds on the relative error in control cost that are optimal in the number of parameters and that highlight salient properties of the system to be controlled such as closed-loop sensitivity and optimal control magnitude. We show experimentally that the Coarse-ID approach enables efficient computation of a stabilizing controller in regimes where simple control schemes that do not take the model uncertainty into account fail to stabilize the true system.},

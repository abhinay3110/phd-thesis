	abstract = {The problem of behaviour prediction for linear parameter-varying systems is considered in the interval framework. It is assumed that the system is subject to uncertain inputs and the vector of scheduling parameters is unmeasurable, but all uncertainties take values in a given admissible set. Then an interval predictor is designed and its stability is guaranteed applying Lyapunov function with a novel structure. The conditions of stability are formulated in the form of linear matrix inequalities. Efficiency of the theoretical results is demonstrated in the application to safe motion planning for autonomous vehicles.},

	abstract="We consider the problem of online planning in a Markov Decision Process when given only access to a generative model, restricted to open-loop policies - i.e. sequences of actions - and under budget constraint. In this setting, the Open-Loop Optimistic Planning (OLOP) algorithm enjoys good theoretical guarantees but is overly conservative in practice, as we show in numerical experiments. We propose a modified version of the algorithm with tighter upper-confidence bounds, KL-OLOP, that leads to better practical performances while retaining the sample complexity bound. Finally, we propose an efficient implementation that significantly improves the time complexity of both algorithms.",

\section{Context and scope}


\paragraph{How should a self-driving car act?}

In the first few weeks of my PhD, I made the following observation: when confronted to this question, say at the occasion of a social dinner, layman interlocutors have a general tendency to conjure up disaster scenarios involving imminent accidents with unavoidable casualties. 
This reflex is likely to stem from the popularisation of the Trolley Problem \citep{Foot1967}, a famous thought experiment in Moral Philosophy, depicted in \Cref{fig:trolley}, in which a runaway trolley is headed straight toward five people tied up on the main track and unable to move. A lever, when pulled, switches the trolley to a side track occupied by one person. What should you do? The field of normative ethics focuses on answering the question of what we \emph{ought} to do, and this dilemma illustrates a clash between two schools of thought: utilitarianism and deontological ethics. 
It has been transposed in the context of Autonomous Driving, for instance in the \emph{Moral Machine} platform \citep{Awad2018}.
% Ethics is a branch of philosophy studying what is the right (or wrong) action to take in any situation. 
Yet when we drive, we seldom find ourselves in such extreme situations, and our thoughts typically focus on less tragic questions than who to sacrifice.
Likewise, this thesis is not so much about solving moral dilemma than addressing the non-dilemma of how to avoid accidents altogether.%, which ultimately implies also avoiding such states of unavoidable collision.

\paragraph{Nuts and bolts of self-driving software}

The typical robotics pipeline, shown in \Cref{fig:robotics-pipeline}, involves three main modules: Perception, Decision, and Control (also named Navigation, Guidance and Control in aerospace engineering).
\TODO{In the Decision module, ...}
Great research efforts have been made to resolve the two end-of-pipe tasks: Perception has benefited from the substantial progress in the field of Computer Vision due to the recent advent of Deep Learning. Control schemes have been developed for ground vehicles to precisely follow a predefined trajectory.
In the Decision task, Route Planning involves graph-search on road network, and Motion Planning is well developed, as will be presented in \Cref{sec:sequential-decision-making}. Behavioural planning has been a neglected area: hitherto, most applications and challenges focused on simple settings with little complexity. In the DARPA Urban Challenge, all challengers reportedly used finite state machines for behavioural planning \citep{Buehler2009}. 

Indeed, \TODO{The winner of the Urban ChallengeBOSS performed several manually  defined  checks  that  used  metrics,  e.g.,  checking the spacing and if the car can accelerate quickly enough, to assure that merging is safe [9]. TeamJunior used a threshold test,  based  on  velocity  and  proximity,  to  find critical  zones where the vehicle has to wait [10]}

In the industry, ADAS features such as LKA, ACC focus on highway driving with limited interaction.

\paragraph{Decision-making under uncertainty}

Assume we have magically access to magical perception. Would we have solved the problem?
We still need to decide of how to act. Even if the present were known, the future would still be uncertain, because we do not know how other agents are going to act.
Human driving behaviour is not deterministic, but it is predictable. Highly structured.
Recall aletoric vs epistemic uncertainty?

Our objectives: 
1. Socially aware decision-making (account for other agents, and how our actions impact their behaviours)
2. A notion of safety. Risk as a constraint ? As a worst-case outcome?

  When we drive, we must comply with two contradictory objectives: \textit{efficiency} and \textit{safety}. In this chapter, we strive to reconcile them by formalising a first notion of \textit{risk}. We consider \glspl+{BMDP}, in which risk is implemented as a cost signal constrained to lie below an \emph{adjustable} threshold. The latter provides the system manufacturer with a slider allowing them to adjust in real-time the level of risk taken by the vehicle. So far, \glspl{BMDP} could only be solved in the case of known dynamics and finite state spaces, which is not suitable for our application which features continuous kinematic states and unknown human behaviours. This chapter extends the state-of-the-art to continuous spaces and unknown dynamics. %We show that the solution to a \gls{BMDP} is a fixed point of a novel Budgeted Bellman Optimality operator. This observation allows us to introduce a natural extension of Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms to address large-scale \glspl{BMDP}. 
  Our approach is motivated by the prospect of training a risk-sensitive driving policy for a two-way road, where overtaking a vehicle requires driving on the wrong lane.\footnote{This chapter is based on an article published in the proceedings of the \emph{32nd conference on advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS)} \citep{CarraraLeurent2019}. It is joint work with Nicolas Carrara, who came up with the algorithm and carried-out the dialogue experiment. I did most of the theoretical analysis, the driving experiment; and we worked together on the exploration procedure and scaling-up the implementation.}

\section{Motivation}

As stated in \Cref{chapter:1}, \glsxtrlong{RL} is a general framework for decision-making under uncertainty. Formally, we seek a policy $\policy\in\cM(\cA)^{\cS}$ that maximises in expectation the $\discountfactor$-discounted return of rewards $\return^{\policy} = \sum_{t=0}^\infty \discountfactor^t \reward(s_t, a_t)$.

However, this modelling assumption comes at a price: no control is given over the spread of the performance distribution \citep{Dann2018}. In many critical real-world applications, including \glsxtrlong{AD}, failures may turn out very costly. This is an issue as most decision-makers would rather give away some amount of expected optimality to increase the performances in the lower-tail of the distribution. As discussed in \Cref{chapter:2}, this has led to the development of several risk-averse variants where the optimisation criteria include other statistics of the performance, such as the worst-case realisation \citep{Iyengar2005,Nilim2005,Wiesemann2013}, the variance-penalised expectation \citep{Tamar2012,Garcia2015}, the Value at Risk \citep{Mausser2003,Luenberger2013}, or the Conditional Value at Risk \citep{Chow2014,Chow2018}.

\glsxtrlong{RL} also assumes that the performance can be described by a single reward function $\reward$. Conversely, real problems typically involve many aspects, some of which can be contradictory \citep{Liu2014}. In our case, a self-driving car needs to balance between progressing quickly on the road and avoiding collisions. In \gls{MORL}, each of these aspects is independently modelled by a separate reward signal. Then, the set of policies is partitioned into 
\begin{enumerate*}[label=(\roman*)]
	\item the class of \emph{dominated} policies $\policy$, for which there exists an \emph{improvement}, \ie another policy $\policy'$ with at least some objectives increased, and none decreased;
	\item the \emph{Pareto front} $\Pi^\star$, of undominated policies, illustrated in \Cref{fig:pareto-front}.
\end{enumerate*}

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.55\linewidth]{img/pareto1}
\caption{A \gls{MOMDP} with two objectives: the rewards $R$ must be maximised, while the costs $C$ must be minimised. The policies are partitioned into dominated policies, shown in light shades of green, and the Pareto front $\Pi^\star$, shown in dark green. Cautious policies with low efficiency and risk are located on the bottom-left, while aggressive policies with high efficiency and risk are on the top-right.}
\label{fig:pareto-front}
\end{figure}

A standard way to cast a \gls+{MOMDP} into an \gls{MDP} is to aggregate several objectives in a single reward function \citep{Roijers2013ASO}. However, this does not allow to explicitly control the trade-off between the different objectives, since higher rewards can compensate for higher penalties. For instance, if a weighted sum is used to balance velocity $v$ and crashes $c$, then for any given choice of weights $\omega$ the optimality equation $\omega_v\expectedvalue[\sum\discountfactor^t v_t] + \omega_a\expectedvalue[\sum\discountfactor^t c_t] = \return^{\star} = \max_{\policy} \return^{\policy}$ is the equation of a line in $(\expectedvalue[\sum\discountfactor^t v_t], \expectedvalue[\sum\discountfactor^t c_t])$, and the automotive company cannot control where its optimal policy $\optimalpolicy$ lies on that line. 

Both of these concerns are addressed in the \glsfirst+{CMDP} setting \citep{Beutler1985,Altman1999}, illustrated in \Cref{fig:cmdp}. In this multi-objective formulation, \hlg{task completion} and \hlr{safety} are considered separately. We equip the \gls{MDP} with a cost signal $\hlr{\constraint} \in \Real^{\cS\times \cA}$ and a cost {budget} $\hlb{\budget}\in\Real$. Similarly to $\hlg{\return^{\policy}}$, we define the return of costs $\hlrb{\constraintreturn[^{\policy}]} = \sum_{t=0}^\infty \discountfactor^t \constraint(s_t, a_t)$ and the new cost-constrained objective:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:cmdp}
\begin{array}{lcr}
\displaystyle \max_{\policy\in\cM(\cA)^{\cS}} \expectedvalue[\hlgb{\return^{\policy}} | s_0=s] & \text{ s.t. } & \expectedvalue[\hlrb{\constraintreturn[^{\policy}]} | s_0=s] \leq \hlbb{\budget}
\end{array}
\end{equation}
This constrained framework allows for better control of the performance-safety trade-off. However, it suffers from a major limitation: the \idx{budget} has to be chosen before training, and cannot be changed afterwards.


\begin{figure}[ht]

	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{img/pareto2}

	\label{fig:bmdp}
\end{subfigure}
\caption{Comparison between the \gls{CMDP} and \gls{BMDP} frameworks.}
\end{figure}

To tackle this issue, the \glsfirst+{BMDP} was introduced in \citep{Boutilier_Lu:uai16} as an extension of \glspl{CMDP} to enable the online control over the {budget} $\budget$ within a closed interval $\budgetspace \subset \Real$ of admissible budgets\index{budget}. Instead of fixing the {budget} prior to training, the objective is now to find a generic optimal policy $\optimalpolicy$ that takes $\budget$ as input so as to solve the corresponding \gls{CMDP} \eqref{eq:cmdp} for all budgets $\budget\in\budgetspace$. This gives the system designer the ability to move in real-time the optimal policy $\optimalpolicy$ along the Pareto front of the different reward-cost trade-offs, as shown in \Cref{fig:bmdp}.

In the seminal work of \citet{Boutilier_Lu:uai16}, \glspl{BMDP} were originally studied in the context of finite states $\cS$, finite horizon, and known \gls{BMDP} parameters. Our first contribution is to re-frame the \gls{BMDP} formulation in the context of continuous states and infinite discounted horizon. We then propose a novel Budgeted Bellman Optimality Operator and prove the optimal value function to be a fixed point of this operator. Second, we use this operator in \gls{BFTQ}, a {batch} \gls{RL} algorithm, for solving \glspl{BMDP} {online}, without prior knowledge of the $(\Ps, \reward, \constraint)$ parameters, by interacting with an {environment}. Third, we scale this algorithm to large problems by (i) providing an efficient implementation of the Budgeted Bellman Optimality operator based on convex programming, (ii) a tailored risk-sensitive exploration procedure, and (iii) leveraging tools from Deep \glsxtrlong{RL} such as \glsxtrlongpl{NN} for function approximation and synchronous parallel computing. Finally, we validate our approach in two {environment}s that display a clear trade-off between rewards and costs: a dialogue system example, and a behavioural planning problem for overtaking on a two-way road. 

\section{Budgeted dynamic programming}
\label{sec:bdp}
We work in the space of budgeted policies\index{budgeted policy}, where $\policy$ both depends on $\budget$ and also outputs the next budget $\budgetaction$. Hence, the budget $\budget$ is neither fixed nor constant as in the \gls{CMDP} setting but instead evolves as part of the dynamics.

We cast the \gls{BMDP} problem as a \gls{MOMDP} problem \citep{Roijers2013ASO} by considering \emph{augmented} state and action spaces $\ocS = \cS\times \budgetspace$ and $\ocA= \cA\times \budgetspace$, and equip them with the augmented dynamics $\augmentedtransition\in \cM(\ocS)^{\ocS \times \ocA}$ defined as:
\begin{equation}
\augmentedtransition\left(\os' \condbar \os, \oa\right) = \augmentedtransition\left((s',\budget') \condbar (s,\budget), (a, \budgetaction)\right) \eqdef \Ps(s'|s, a)\dirac(\budget' - \budgetaction),
\end{equation}
where $\dirac$ is the Dirac indicator distribution.

In other words, in these augmented dynamics, the output budget $\budgetaction$ returned at time $t$ by a \idx{budgeted policy} $\budgetedpolicy\in \policies=\cM(\ocA)^{\ocS}$ will be used to condition the policy at the next timestep $t+1$.

We stack the rewards and cost functions in a single \emph{vectorial} signal $\oR \in (\Real^2)^{{\ocS \times \ocA}}$:

\begin{definition}
	\begin{leftbar}[defnbar]
	Given an augmented transition $(\os, \oa) =((s,\budget), (a, \budgetaction))$, we define
	\begin{equation}
	\gls+{oR}(\os, \oa) \eqdef  \begin{bmatrix}
	\hlg{\R(s, a)}\\
	\hlr{\constraint(s, a)}
	\end{bmatrix}\in\Real^2.
	\end{equation}
	\end{leftbar}
\end{definition}

Likewise, we augment the return:

\begin{definition}
	\begin{leftbar}[defnbar]
	The return $\augmentedreturn[^{\budgetedpolicy}] = (\return[^{\budgetedpolicy}], \constraintreturn[^{\budgetedpolicy}])$ of a \idx{budgeted policy} $\budgetedpolicy\in\policies$ refers to
	\begin{equation}
	\gls+{augmentedreturn}[^{\budgetedpolicy}] \eqdef \sum_{t=0}^\infty \discountfactor^t \oR(\os_t, \oa_t).
	\end{equation}
	\end{leftbar}
\end{definition}

as well as the value functions:

\begin{definition}
	\begin{leftbar}[defnbar]
	The value functions $\oV[^{\budgetedpolicy}]$, $\oQ[^{\budgetedpolicy}]$ of a \idx{budgeted policy} $\budgetedpolicy\in\policies$ are defined as
	\begin{align}
	\begin{split}
	\label{eq:value-function}
	\gls+{oV}[^{\budgetedpolicy}](\os) &= (\hlg{\Vr[^\budgetedpolicy]}, \hlr{\Vc[^\budgetedpolicy]}) \eqdef \expectedvalue\left[ \augmentedreturn^{\budgetedpolicy} \condbar \ov{s_0} = \os\right] \\
	\gls+{oQ}[^{\budgetedpolicy}](\os, \oa) &= (\hlg{\Qr[^\budgetedpolicy]}, \hlr{\Qc[^\budgetedpolicy]}) \eqdef \expectedvalue\left[ \augmentedreturn^{\budgetedpolicy} \condbar \ov{s_0} = \os, \ov{a_0} = \oa\right].
	\end{split}
	\end{align}
	\end{leftbar}
\end{definition}

We restrict $\ocS$ to feasible budgets only: $\ocS_f \eqdef \{(s,\budget)\in\ocS: \exists \budgetedpolicy\in\policies, \Vc[^\budgetedpolicy](s) \leq \budget\}$ that we assume to be non-empty for the \gls{BMDP} to admit a solution. We still write $\ocS$ in place of $\ocS_f$ for brevity of notations.

\begin{proposition}[Budgeted Bellman Expectation]
	\begin{leftbar}[propositionbar]
	\label{prop:bellman-expectation}
	The value functions $\oV^{\budgetedpolicy}$ and $ \oQ^{\budgetedpolicy}$ verify:
	\begin{align}
	\oV^{\budgetedpolicy}(\os) = \sum_{\oa\in\ocA}\budgetedpolicy(\oa | \os) \oQ^{\budgetedpolicy}(\os, \oa) \qquad \oQ^{\budgetedpolicy}(\os, \oa) = \gls{oR}(\os, \oa) + \discountfactor\sum_{\os'\in\ocS}\augmentedtransition\left(\os' \condbar \os, \oa\right) \oV^{\budgetedpolicy}(\os'). \label{eq:bellman_expectation}
	\end{align}
	Moreover, consider the Budgeted Bellman Evaluation\index{Bellman Evaluation} operator $\abo^{\gls+{budgetedpolicy}}$:
	$\forall \oQ\in(\Real^2)^{\ocS\ocA}, \os\in\ocS, \oa\in\ocA$,
	\begin{align}
	\label{eq:bellman_expectation_operator}
	\gls+{abo}^{\gls+{budgetedpolicy}} \oQ(\os, \oa) &\eqdef \gls{oR}(\os, \oa) + \discountfactor \sum_{\os'\in\ocS}\sum_{\oa'\in\ocA}\augmentedtransition(\os'|\os, \oa)\budgetedpolicy(\oa'|\os') \oQ(\os', \oa').
	\end{align}
	Then $\abo^{\budgetedpolicy}$ is a $\discountfactor$-contraction and $\oQ^{\budgetedpolicy}$ is its unique fixed point.
	\end{leftbar}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	We provide the proof in \Cref{sec:proof-bell-expect}.
\end{proof}

We now come to the definition of budgeted optimality. We want an optimal budgeted policy to: 
\begin{enumerate*}[label=(\roman*)]
	\item respect the cost budget $\budget$;
	\item maximise the $\discount$-discounted return of rewards $\return$;
	\item in case of tie, minimise the $\discount$-discounted return of costs $\constraintreturn$.
\end{enumerate*}

\begin{definition}[Budgeted Optimality]
	\begin{leftbar}[defnbar]
	To that end, we define for all $\os\in\ocS$,
	\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
		\item admissible policies $\hlb{\policies_a}$ as
		\begin{equation}
		\hlb{\policies_a(\os)} \eqdef \{\budgetedpolicy\in\policies: \hlbb{\Vc[^\budgetedpolicy](\os) \leq \budget}\}\text{ where }\os = (s, \budget);
		\end{equation}
		\item the optimal value function for rewards $\hlg{\Vr[^\star]}$ and candidate policies $\hlg{\policies_r}$ as
		\begin{equation}
		\hlg{\Vr[^\star](\os)} \eqdef \hlg{\max}_{\budgetedpolicy\in\hlb{\policies_a(\os)}}  \Vr[^\budgetedpolicy](\os) \qquad\qquad \hlg{\policies_r(\os)} \eqdef \hlg{\argmax}_{\budgetedpolicy\in\policies_a(\os)}  \Vr[^\budgetedpolicy](\os);
		\end{equation}
		\item the optimal value function for costs $\Vc[^\star]$ and optimal policies $\policies^\star$ as
		\begin{equation}
		\hlr{\Vc[^\star](\os)} \eqdef \hlr{\min}_{\budgetedpolicy\in \hlg{\policies_r(\os)}}  \Vc[^\budgetedpolicy](\os), \qquad\qquad \policies^{\star}(\os) \eqdef \hlr{\argmin}_{\budgetedpolicy\in\policies_r(\os)}  \Vc[^\budgetedpolicy](\os).
		\end{equation}
	\end{enumerate}
	We define the budgeted action-value function $\gls+{oQ}^{\star}$ similarly as
	\begin{equation}
	{\Qr[^\star](\os, \oa)} \eqdef \max_{\budgetedpolicy\in\policies_a(\os)}  \Qr[^\budgetedpolicy](\os, \oa) \qquad\qquad {\Qc[^\star](\os, \oa)} \eqdef \min_{\budgetedpolicy\in\policies_r(\os)}  \Qc[^\budgetedpolicy](\os, \oa),
	\end{equation}
	and denote $\gls+{oV}^{\star} = (\hlg{\Vr[^\star]}, \hlr{\Vc[^\star]})$, $\gls+{oQ}^{\star} = (\hlg{\Qr[^\star]}, \hlr{\Qc[^\star]})$.
	\end{leftbar}
\end{definition}

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{img/SafeRiskyExample}
	\caption[Example of relaxed Budgeted Markov Decision Process]{On the left hand side, a simple \textit{risky-vs-safe} \gls{BMDP}. The probability of picking the risky action is $\pi_1$. On the right hand side an attempt to relax the problem with negative rewards.}
	\label{fig:stochasticneeded}
\end{figure}

Contrary to \glspl{MDP} which always admit a deterministic optimal policy, this is generally not the case in a \gls{CMDP}, and \textit{a fortiori} in a \gls{BMDP}.
To illustrate this fact, let us consider the trivial \gls{BMDP} on the left of \Cref{fig:stochasticneeded}.
In this example we have $\return^{\policy}=10\pi_1$ and $\constraintreturn[^{\policy}]=\pi_1$. The \idx{deterministic policy} consisting in always picking the safe action is feasible for any $\budget\geq 0$. But if $\budget=1/2$, the most rewarding feasible policy is to randomly pick the safe and risky actions with equal probabilities.
If we attempt to cast this \gls{BMDP} into an \gls{MDP} by replacing the costs by negative rewards, the corresponding greedy policy will be deterministic\index{deterministic policy}, hence sub-optimal.


However, the optimal value function $\oQ^\star$ in a \gls{BMDP} can still be characterised by a fixed-point equation, similarly to \Cref{thm:bellman-optimality-mdp} for \glspl{MDP}.

\begin{theorem}[Budgeted Bellman Optimality]
	\begin{leftbar}[theorembar]
	\label{thm:bellman-optimality}
	The optimal budgeted action-value function $\oQ^{\star}$ verifies
	\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:bellman-optimality}
	\oQ^{\star}(\os, \oa) = \gls+{abo}^{\star}\oQ^{\star}(\os, \oa) \eqdef \gls{oR}(\os, \oa) + \discountfactor \sum_{\os'\in\ocS} \augmentedtransition(\ov{s'} | \os, \oa)\sum_{\ov{a'}\in \ocA} \budgetedpolicy_\text{greedy}(\ov{a'}|\ov{s'}; \oQ^{\star}) \oQ^{\star}(\ov{s'}, \ov{a'}),
	\end{equation}
	where the greedy policy $\budgetedpolicy_\text{greedy}$ is defined by: $\forall \os=(s,\budget)\in \ocS, \oa\in
	\ocA, \forall \oQ\in(\Real^2)^{\ocA\times\ocS},$
	\begin{subequations}
		\label{eq:pi_greedy}
		\begin{align}
		\budgetedpolicy_\text{greedy}(\oa|\os; \oQ) \in &\argmin_{\rho\in\policies_r^{\oQ}} \expectedvalueover{\oa\sim\rho}\Qc(\os, \oa), \label{eq:pi_greedy_cost}\\
		\text{where }\quad\policies_r^{\oQ} \eqdef &\argmax_{\rho\in\cM(\ocA)} \expectedvalueover{\oa\sim\rho} \Qr(\os, \oa) \label{eq:pi_greedy_reward}\\
		& \text{ s.t. }  \expectedvalueover{\oa\sim\rho} \Qc(\os, \oa) \leq \budget. \label{eq:pi_greedy_constraint}
		\end{align}
	\end{subequations}
	\end{leftbar}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	We provide the proof in \Cref{sec:proof-bell-optim}.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}[Appearance of the greedy policy]
	\begin{leftbar}[remarkbar]
	\label{rmk:greedy}
	In classical \glsxtrlong{RL}, the greedy policy takes a simple form $\policy_\text{greedy}(s; \Q^{\star}) = \argmax_{a\in\cA} \Q^{\star}(s, a)$, and the term $\policy_\text{greedy}(a'|s';\Q^{\star}) \Q^{\star}(s', a')$ in \eqref{eq:bellman-optimality} conveniently simplifies to $\max_{a'\in \cA} \Q^{\star}(s', a')$. Unfortunately, in a budgeted setting the greedy policy requires solving the nested constrained optimisation program \eqref{eq:pi_greedy} at each state and budget in order to apply this Budgeted Bellman Optimality operator.
	\end{leftbar}
\end{remark}

\begin{proposition}[Optimality of the greedy policy]
	\begin{leftbar}[propositionbar]
	\label{prop:greedy_optimal}
	The greedy policy $\budgetedpolicy_\text{greedy}(\cdot~; \oQ^{\star})$ is {uniformly} optimal: 
	\begin{equation*}
	\text{for all }\os\in\ocS,\,\budgetedpolicy_\text{greedy}(\cdot~; \oQ^{\star})\in\policies^{\star}(\os). 
	\end{equation*}
	In particular, 
	$$\oV^{\budgetedpolicy_\text{greedy}(\cdot; \oQ^{\star})} = \oV^{\star} \text{ and } \oQ^{\budgetedpolicy_\text{greedy}(\cdot; \oQ^{\star})}= \oQ^{\star}.$$
	\end{leftbar}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	We provide the proof in \Cref{sec:proof-greedy-optim}.
\end{proof}

\paragraph{Budgeted Value Iteration}


\begin{algorithm}
	\DontPrintSemicolon
	\KwData{$P, R_r, R_c$}
	\KwResult{$Q^{\star}$}
	$Q_{0} \leftarrow 0$\;
	\Repeat{convergence ($\|Q_{k+1} - Q_k\|_\infty \leq \epsilon$)}{
		$Q_{k+1} \leftarrow \cT Q_k$\;
	}
	\caption{Budgeted Value Iteration}
	\label{alg:bvi}
\end{algorithm}

The Budgeted Bellman Optimality equation is a fixed-point equation, which motivates the introduction of a fixed-point iteration procedure. We introduce \Cref{alg:bvi}, a \glsxtrlong{DP} algorithm for solving known \glspl{BMDP}. If it were to converge to a unique fixed point, this algorithm would provide a way to compute $\oQ^{\star}$ and recover the associated optimal budgeted policy $\budgetedpolicy_\text{greedy}(\cdot~; \oQ^{\star})$.

\begin{theorem}[Non-contractivity of $\abo^{\star}$]
	\begin{leftbar}[theorembar]
	\label{thm:contraction}
	For any \gls{BMDP} ($\cS,\cA,\Ps,\R,\constraint,\discountfactor$) with $|\cA| \geq 2$, $\abo^{\star}$ is \emph{not} a contraction. Precisely, $$\forall\epsilon>0, \exists \oQ[^1],\,\oQ[^2]\in(\Real^2)^{\ocS\ocA}:\|\abo \oQ[^1]-\abo \oQ[^2]\|_\infty \geq \frac{1}{\epsilon}\|\oQ[^1] - \oQ[^2]\|_\infty.$$
	\end{leftbar}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	We provide the proof in \Cref{sec:proof-contraction}.
\end{proof}

Unfortunately, as $\abo^{\star}$ is not a contraction, we can guarantee neither the convergence of \Cref{alg:bvi} nor the unicity of its fixed points. Despite those theoretical limitations, we empirically observed the convergence to a fixed point in our experiments (\Cref{sec:brl-experiments}). We provide a possible explanation:

\begin{theorem}[Contractivity of $\cT$ on smooth $Q$-functions]
	\begin{leftbar}[theorembar]
	\label{thm:contractivity-smooth}
	The operator $\abo^{\star}$ is a contraction when restricted to the subset $\cL_{\discountfactor}$ of $\oQ$-functions such that \enquote{$\Qr$ is Lipschitz with respect to $\Qc$}:
	\begin{equation}
	\cL_\discount = \left\{\begin{array}{cc}
	\oQ\in(\Real^2)^{\ocS\ocA}\text{ s.t. }\exists L<\frac{1}{\discount}-1: \forall \os\in\ocS,\oa_1,\oa_2\in\ocA,   \\
	|\Qr(\os,\oa_1) - \Qr(\os,\oa_2)| \leq L|\Qc(\os,\oa_1) - \Qc(\os,\oa_2)|
	\end{array}\right\},
	\end{equation}
	\begin{equation*}
	\forall \oQ[^1],\oQ[^2]\in \cL_\discount,\; \|\abo \oQ[^1]- \abo \oQ[^2]\|_\infty  < \|\oQ[^1]-\oQ[^2]\|_\infty.
	\end{equation*}
	\end{leftbar}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	We provide the proof in \Cref{sec:contraction-with-smooth}.
\end{proof}

Thus, we expect that \Cref{alg:bvi} is likely to converge when $\oQ^{\star}$ is smooth, but could diverge if the slope of $\oQ^{\star}$ is too high.  $L^2$-regularisation can be used to encourage smoothness and mitigate the risk of divergence.


\section{Budgeted reinforcement learning}

\label{sec:brl}

In this section, we consider \glspl{BMDP} with unknown parameters that must be solved by interaction with an environment. 

\subsection{Budgeted Fitted-Q}
\label{subsec:bftq}

When the \gls{BMDP} is unknown, we need to adapt \Cref{alg:bvi} to work with a batch of samples $\cD=\{(\os_t,\oa_t,\overline{r}_t,\os_t')\}_{t\in [1,N]}$ collected by interaction with the environment. Applying $\abo^{\star}$ in \eqref{eq:bellman-optimality} would require computing an expectation $\expectedvalue_{\os'\sim \augmentedtransition}$ over next states $\os'$ and hence an access to the model $\augmentedtransition$. We instead use $\hat{\abo^{\star}}$, a sampling operator, in which this expectation is replaced by
\begin{equation*}
\hat{\abo^{\star}} \oQ(\os, \oa, \overline{r}, \os') \eqdef \overline{r} + \discount \sum_{\ov{a'}\in \ocA} \pi_\text{greedy}(\ov{a'}|\ov{s'}; \oQ) \oQ(\ov{s'}, \ov{a'}).
\end{equation*}
We introduce in \Cref{alg:bftq} the \gls{BFTQ} algorithm, an extension of the \gls{FTQ} algorithm adapted to solve unknown \glspl{BMDP}. Because we work with continuous state space $\cS$ and budget space $\budgetspace$, we need to employ function-approximation in order to generalise to nearby states and budgets. Precisely, given a parametrized model $\oQ_\params$, we seek to minimise a regression loss $\cL(\oQ_\params, \oQ_\text{target};\cD) = \sum_{\cD} \|\oQ_\params(\os, \oa) - \oQ_\text{target}(\os, \oa, r, \os')\|_2^2$.
Any model can be used, such as linear models, regression trees, or \glsxtrlongpl{NN}.

\subsection{Risk-sensitive exploration}
\label{sec:exploration}

In order to run \Cref{alg:bftq}, we must first gather a batch of samples $\mathcal{D}$. The following strategy is motivated by the intuition that a wide variety of risk levels needs to be experienced during training, which can be achieved by enforcing the risk constraints during data collection. Ideally, we would need samples from the asymptotic state-budget distribution $\lim_{t\rightarrow\infty}\probability{\os_t}$ induced by an optimal policy $\optimalbudgetedpolicy$ given an initial distribution $\probability{\os_0}$, but as we are actually building this policy, it is not possible. Following the same idea of $\epsilon$-greedy exploration for \FTQ, we introduce an algorithm for risk-sensitive exploration. We follow an exploration policy: a mixture between a random \idx{budgeted policy} $\budgetedpolicy_\text{rand}$ and the current greedy policy $\budgetedpolicy_\text{greedy}$. The batch $\cD$ is split into several minibatches generated sequentially, and $\budgetedpolicy_\text{greedy}$ is updated by running \Cref{alg:bftq} on $\cD$ upon mini-batch completion. $\budgetedpolicy_\text{rand}$ is designed to obtain trajectories that only explore feasible budgets: we impose that the joint distribution $\probability{a, \budgetaction|s, \budget}$ verifies $\expectedvalue[\budgetaction]\leq\budget$. This condition defines a probability simplex $\Delta_{\ocA}$ from which we sample uniformly. Finally, when interacting with an environment, the initial state $s_0$ is usually sampled from a starting distribution $\probability{s_0}$. In the budgeted setting, we also need to sample the initial budget $\budget_0$. Importantly, we pick a uniform distribution $\probability{\budget_0} = \gls+{uniform}(\budgetspace)$ so that the entire range of risk-level is explored, and not only reward-seeking behaviours as would be the case with a traditional \idx{risk-neutral} $\epsilon$-greedy strategy. The pseudo-code of our exploration procedure is shown in \Cref{alg:risk-sensitive-exploration}.% in \Cref{sec:risk-sensitive-supp}.

%\section{A scalable implementation}
%\label{sec:scalable-bftq}
In the following, we introduce an implementation of the \BFTQ algorithm designed to operate efficiently and handle large batches of experiences $\cD$.

\subsection{How to compute the greedy policy?}
\label{subsec:compute-greedy-policy}
As stated in \Cref{rmk:greedy}, computing the greedy policy $\budgetedpolicy_\text{greedy}$ in \eqref{eq:bellman-optimality} is not trivial since it requires solving the nested constrained optimisation program \eqref{eq:pi_greedy}.
However, it can be solved efficiently by exploiting the \emph{structure} of the set of solutions with respect to $\budget$, that is, concave and increasing.

\begin{proposition}[Equality of $\budgetedpolicy_\text{greedy}$ and $\budgetedpolicy_\text{hull}$]
	\begin{leftbar}[propositionbar]
	\label{prop:bftq_pi_hull}
	The greedy policy $\budgetedpolicy_\text{greedy}$ is equal to a convex-hull policy $\budgetedpolicy_\text{hull}$ defined in \Cref{alg:pi_hull}:
    \begin{equation*}
        \budgetedpolicy_\text{greedy}(\oa|\os; \oQ) = \budgetedpolicy_\text{hull}(\oa|\os; \oQ).
    \end{equation*}
    Thus, \Cref{alg:bvi} and \Cref{alg:bftq} can be run by replacing $\budgetedpolicy_\text{greedy}$ in the equation \eqref{eq:bellman-optimality} of $\abo$ with $\budgetedpolicy_\text{hull}$.
    \end{leftbar}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	We provide the proof in \Cref{sec:proof_pi_hull}.
\end{proof}

\begin{algorithm}[th]

    \KwData{$\os=(s,\budget)$, $\oQ$}

    $\cF_{\oQ} \leftarrow \cF\cap \oQ(\os,\ocA)$\;

    \uIf{find two successive points $((q_c^1, q_r^1), (q_c^2, q_r^2))$ of $\cF_{\oQ}$ such that $q_c^1 \leq \budget < q_c^2$}{
    $p \leftarrow (\budget - q_c^1) / (q_c^2 - q_c^1)$\;
    \Return the mixture $(1-p)\dirac(\oa-\oa^1) + p\dirac(\oa-\oa^2)$\;
    }}
    \lElse{\Return $\dirac(\oa - \argmax_{\oa} \Qr(\os,\oa))$\tcp*[f]{budget $\budget$ always respected}}
    \caption{Convex hull policy $\budgetedpolicy_\text{hull}(\oa|\os; \oQ)$}
    \label{alg:pi_hull}
\end{algorithm}

\begin{figure}[t]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{img/pi.pdf}
	\caption{Representation of $\pi_\text{hull}$. When the budget lies between $Q(\os,\oa_1)$ and $Q(\os,\oa_2)$, two points of the top frontier of the convex hull, then the policy is a mixture of these two points.}
	\label{fig:hull}
\end{figure}

The computation of $\pi_\text{hull}$ in \Cref{alg:pi_hull} is illustrated in \Cref{fig:hull}: first we get rid of dominated points. Then we compute the top frontier of the convex hull of the $Q$-function. Next, we find the two closest augmented actions $\ov{a}_1$ and $\ov{a}_2$ with cost-value $Q_c$ surrounding $\beta$:  $Q_c(\os,\oa_1)\leq\beta<Q_c(\os,\oa_2)$. Finally, we mix the two actions such that the expected spent budget is equal to $\beta$. Because of the concavity of the convex hull top frontier, any other combination of augmented actions would lead to a lower expected reward $Q_r$. 




\subsection{Function approximation}

\glsxtrlongpl{NN} are well suited to model $\oQ$-functions in \gls{RL} algorithms \citep{Mnih2015humanlevel}. We approximate $\oQ = (\Qr, \Qc)$ using one single \glsxtrlong{NN}, as illustrated in \Cref{fig:bftq-architecture}. Thus, the two components are optimised jointly, which accelerates convergence and fosters the learning of useful shared representations. Moreover, as in \citep{Mnih2015humanlevel}, we are dealing with a finite (categorical) action space $\cA$. Instead of including the action in the input, we add an output to the $\oQ$-function for each action. Again, it provides a faster convergence toward useful shared representations and it only requires one forward pass to evaluate all action values. Finally, beside the state $s$ there is one more input to a budgeted $\oQ$-function:~the budget $\budgetaction$. This budget is a scalar value whereas the state $s$ is a vector of potentially large size. To avoid a weak influence of the budget $\budget_a$ compared to the state $s$ in the prediction, we include an additional encoder for the budget, whose width and depth may depend on the application. A straightforward choice is a single layer with the same width as the state.

\subsection{Parallel computing}
\label{subsec:parallel-computing}
In a simulated environment, a first process that can be distributed is the collection of transitions in the exploration procedure of \Cref{alg:risk-sensitive-exploration}, as $\budgetedpolicy_\text{greedy}$ stays constant within each minibatch which avoids the need of synchronisation between workers. Second, the main bottleneck of \gls{BFTQ} is the computation of the target $\abo \oQ$. Indeed, when computing $\budgetedpolicy_\text{hull}$ we must perform at each epoch a Graham-scan of complexity $\cO(|\cA||\tilde{\budgetspace}| \log |\cA||\tilde{\budgetspace}|)$ per transition in $\cD$ to compute the convex hulls of $\oQ$ (where $\tilde{\budgetspace}$ is a finite discretisation of $\budgetspace$). The resulting total time-complexity\footnote{$\log_{\gamma}(\epsilon(1-\gamma))$ is the sample complexity of Value Iteration with accuracy $\epsilon$, and each of these iterations requires a Graham-scan for each state in the dataset $\cD$, action $a\in\cA$ and budget $\beta\in\tilde{\budgetspace}$.} is $\cO(\frac|\cD||\cA||\tilde{\budgetspace}|\log_{\gamma}(\epsilon(1-\gamma)) \log |\cA||\tilde{\budgetspace}|)$. This operation can easily be distributed over several CPUs provided that we first evaluate the model $\oQ(\os',\cA \times \tilde{\budgetspace})$ for each state $\os$ extracted from the dataset $\cD$, which can be done in a single forward pass. By using multiprocessing in the computations of $\budgetedpolicy_\text{hull}$, we enjoy a linear speedup.
The full description of our scalable implementation of \gls{BFTQ} is recalled in \Cref{alg:bftq_full}.

\section{Experiments}
\label{sec:brl-experiments}
There are two hypotheses we want to validate.

\paragraph{Exploration strategies} We claimed in \Cref{sec:exploration} that a \idx{risk-sensitive} exploration was required in the setting of \glspl{BMDP}. We test this hypothesis by confronting our strategy to a classical \idx{risk-neutral} strategy. The latter is chosen to be a \idx{$\epsilon$-greedy} policy slowly transitioning from a random to a greedy policy\footnote{We train this greedy policy using \FTQ.} that aims to maximise $\expectedvalue_{\policy} \return^{\policy}$ regardless of $\expectedvalue_{\policy} \constraintreturn[^{\policy}]$. The quality of the resulting batch $\cD$ is assessed by training a \gls{BFTQ} policy and comparing the resulting performance.

\paragraph{Budgeted algorithms} We compare our \BFTQ algorithm to an \FTQl baseline. This baseline consists in approximating the BMDP by a finite set of CMDPs problems. We solve each of these CMDP using the standard technique of Lagrangian Relaxation: the cost constraint is converted into a soft penalty weighted by a Lagrangian multiplier $\lambda$ in a surrogate reward function: $\max_{\policy} \expectedvalue_{\policy}[\return^{\policy} - \lambda \constraintreturn[^{\policy}]]$.
As shown in \Cref{fig:Lagrangian}, the optimal deterministic policy can be obtained by a line-search on the Lagrange multiplier values $\lambda$.
Then, according to \citet[Theorem 4.4]{Beutler1985}, the optimal policy is a randomised mixture of two deterministic policies: the safest deterministic policy that violates the constraint $\pi_{\lambda-}$ and the most risky feasible policy $\pi_{\lambda+}$.
The resulting \glspl{MDP} can be solved by any RL algorithm, and we chose \FTQ for being closest to \BFTQ.
In our experiments, a single training of \BFTQ corresponds to 10 training runs for \FTQl policies. Each run was repeated $N_{\text{seeds}}$ times. Given the high variance, it requires a lot of simulations to get a proper estimate of the calibration curve. Our purpose is to avoid this calibration phase.

	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{img/CalibrationExample}
	\caption{Calibration of a penalty multiplier according to the budget $\budget$. The optimal multiplier $\lambda^{\star}_{\text{avg}}$ is the smallest one to satisfy the budget constraint on average. Safer policies can also be selected according to the largest deviation from this mean cost.}
	\label{fig:Lagrangian}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Environments}
\label{subsec:environments}
We evaluate our method on three different environments involving reward-cost trade-offs.

\paragraph{Corridors}
This simple environment is only meant to highlight clearly the specificity of exploration in a budgeted setting. It is a continuous gridworld with Gaussian perturbations, consisting in a maze composed of two corridors: a risky one with high rewards and costs, and a safe one with low rewards and no cost. In both corridors, the outermost cell is the one yielding the most reward, which motivates an in-depth exploration.

\begin{table}[ht!]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{lll}
        \toprule
        Parameter & Description & Value\tabularnewline
        \midrule
        - & Size of the environment & 7 x 6\tabularnewline
        - & \makecell[l]{Standard deviation of the Gaussian \\noise applied to actions} & (0.25,0.25)\tabularnewline
        H & Trajectory duration & 9\tabularnewline
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Parameters of \texttt{Corridors}}
    \label{tab:param-corridors}
\end{table}

\paragraph{Spoken dialogue system}
Our second application is a dialogue-based slot-filling simulation that has already benefited from batch RL optimisation in the past~\citep{Li2009ReinforcementLF,chandramohan2010optimizing,pietquin2011sample}. The system fills in a form of slot-values by interacting a user through speech, before sending them a response. For example, in a restaurant reservation domain, it may ask for three slots: the area of the restaurant, the price range and the food type. The user could respectively provide those three slot-values : \texttt{Cambridge}, \texttt{Cheap} and \texttt{Indian-food}. In this application, we do not focus on how to extract such information from the user utterances; but rather on the decision-making for filling in the form. To that end, the system can choose among a set of generic actions. As in \citep{carrara2018safe}, there are two ways of asking for a slot value: a slot value can be either be provided with an utterance, which may cause speech recognition errors with some probability, or by requiring the user to fill in the slots by using a numeric pad. In this case, there are no recognition errors but a counterpart risk of hang-up: we assume that manually filling a key-value form is time-consuming and annoying. The environment yields a reward if all slots are filled without errors, and a constraint if the user hang-ups. Thus, there is a clear trade-off between using utterances and potentially committing a mistake, or using the numeric pad and risking a premature hang-up.

\begin{table}[ht!]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{lll}
        \toprule
        Parameter & Description & Value\tabularnewline
        \midrule

        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Parameters of \texttt{Slot-Filling}}
    \label{tab:param-slot-filling}
\end{table}

\paragraph{Two-way road}
In our third application, we use the \highwayenv environment presented in \Cref{chapter:3,chapter:a}.
We define a task that displays a clear trade-off between safety and efficiency, illustrated in \Cref{fig:two-way}. As we mentioned, the agent controls a vehicle with a finite set $\cA$ of manoeuvres \eqref{eq:action-space} implemented by low-level controllers. It is driving on a two-way road populated with other traffic participants: the vehicles in front of the agent drive slowly, and there are incoming vehicles on the opposite lane. The parameters controlling their behaviours are randomised, which introduces some uncertainty concerning their possible future trajectories.
The task consists in driving as fast as possible, which is modelled by a reward proportional to the velocity: $\R(s_t, a_t) \propto v_t$. This motivates the agent to try and overtake its preceding vehicles by driving fast on the opposite lane. This optimal but overly aggressive behaviour can be tempered through a cost function that embodies a safety objective: $\constraint(s_t, a_t)$ is set to $1/H$ whenever the ego-vehicle is driving on the opposite lane, where $H$ is the trajectory horizon. Thus, the constrained signal $\constraintreturn$ is the maximum proportion of time that the agent is allowed to drive on the wrong side of the road.

\begin{figure}[t]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{img/two-way}
	\caption{The two-way road environment requires the vehicle to drive in the wrong lane and risk front collisions in order to overtake slow vehicles.}

    \begin{tabular}{lll}
        \toprule
        Parameter & Description & Value\tabularnewline
        \midrule

    \end{tabular}

\end{table}

\subsection{Results}
\label{subsec:results}
In the following figures, each patch represents the mean and 95\% confidence interval over $N_{\text{seeds}}$ seeds of the means of $(\return^{\policy},\constraintreturn[^{\policy}])$ ($(\return^{\budgetedpolicy},\constraintreturn[^{\budgetedpolicy}])$ for \BFTQ) over $N_\text{trajs}$ trajectories. That way, we display the variation related to learning (and batches) rather than the variation in the execution of the policies.

We first bring to light the role of risk-sensitive exploration in the \text{corridors} environment. \Cref{fig:exploration-trajs} shows how the two strategies behave in the corridor environment: the risk-neutral procedure focuses on high-reward corridor only, while the risk-sensitive procedure also explores low-risk trajectories. Videos showing the data collection process are available\footnote{\href{https://budgeted-rl.github.io/\#risk-sensitive-exploration}{https://budgeted-rl.github.io/\#risk-sensitive-exploration}}. In \Cref{fig:exploration-perfs}, we observe that this better distributed exploration translates as a uniformly better performance across the range $\budgetspace$ of risk budgets. 
When the budget is low, the corresponding optimal budgeted policy $\budgetedpolicy^\star$ takes the safest path on the left. When the budget increases, it gradually switches to the other lane, earning higher rewards but also costs. This gradual process could not be achieved with a deterministic policy as it would choose either one path or the other. Videos illustrating these optimal policies for different level of risks are available \footnote{\href{https://budgeted-rl.github.io/\#optimal-budgeted-policies-learnt-with-a-risk-sensitive-exploration}{https://budgeted-rl.github.io/\#optimal-budgeted-policies-learnt-with-a-risk-sensitive-exploration}}.

	\end{center}
\end{figure}

In a second experiment displayed in \Cref{sec:brl-results}, we compare the performance of \FTQl to that of \BFTQ in the dialogue and autonomous driving tasks. 
For each algorithm, we plot the reward-cost trade-off curve. In both cases, \BFTQ performs almost as well as \FTQl despite only requiring a single model. All budgets are well-respected on \text{slot-filling}, but on \text{highway-env} we can observe an underestimation of $Q_c$, since \eg $\expectedvalue[\constraintreturn|\budget=0] \simeq 0.1 $. This underestimation can be a consequence of two approximations: the use of the sampling operator $\hat{\abo}$ instead of the true population operator $\cT$, and the use of the neural network function approximation $\oQ_\params$ instead of $\oQ$.
Still, \BFTQ provides better control over the expected cost of the policy, than \FTQl. Besides, \BFTQ behaves more consistently than \FTQl overall, as shown by its lower extra-seed variance.
Qualitatively, the budgeted agents display a variety of behaviours, shown in several videos\footnote{\href{https://budgeted-rl.github.io/\#driving-styles}{https://budgeted-rl.github.io/\#driving-styles}}. When $\budget = 1$, the ego-vehicle drives in a very aggressive style: it immediately switches to the opposite lane and drives as fast as possible to pass slower vehicles, swiftly changing lanes to avoid incoming traffic. On the contrary, when $\budget = 0$, the ego-vehicle is conservative: it stays on its lane and drives at a low velocity. With intermediate budgets such as $\budget = 0.2$, the agent sometimes decides to overtake its front vehicle but promptly steers back to its original lane afterwards.

\section*{Discussion}

\Cref{alg:bftq} is an algorithm for solving large unknown \glspl{BMDP} with continuous states. To the best of our knowledge, no algorithm in the current literature combines all those features.

Algorithms have been proposed for \glspl{CMDP}, which are less flexible sub-problems of the more general \gls{BMDP}. When the environment parameters ($\Ps$, $\R$, $\constraint$) are known but not tractable, solutions relying on function approximation~\citep{Undurti2011} or approximate linear programming~\citep{Poupart2015} have been proposed. For unknown environments, Online algorithms \citep{Geibel2005, Abe2010,Achiam2017,Chow2018} and a batch algorithm \citep{Thomas2015, Ghavamzadeh2016, Laroche2019,Le2019} can solve large unknown \glspl{CMDP}. Nevertheless, these approaches are limited in that the constraints thresholds are fixed before training and cannot be updated in real-time at policy execution to select the desired level of risk.

\paragraph{Budgeted Markov Decision Processes algorithms}
To our knowledge, there were only two ways of solving a \gls{BMDP}. The first one is to approximate it with a finite set of \glspl{CMDP} (\eg see our \FTQl baseline). As explained on \Cref{fig:Lagrangian}, the optimal \idx{deterministic policy} can be obtained by a line-search on the Lagrange multiplier values $\lambda$. Then, according to \citet[Theorem 4.4]{Beutler1985}, the optimal policy is a randomised mixture of two deterministic policies\index{deterministic policy}: the safest \idx{deterministic policy} that violates the constraint $\policy_{\lambda-}$ and the riskier of the feasible ones $\policy_{\lambda+}$. So \gls{FTQ} can be easily adapted for continuous states \gls{CMDP} and \gls{BMDP} through this methodology, but given the high variance, it requires many simulations to get a proper estimate of the calibration curve. Our solution not only requires one single model but also avoids any supplementary interaction.

The only other existing \gls{BMDP} algorithm, and closest work to ours, is the \gls{DP} algorithm proposed by \citet{Boutilier_Lu:uai16}. However, their work was established for finite state spaces only, and their solution relies heavily on this property. For instance, they enumerate and sort the next states $s'\in\cS$ by their expected value-by-cost, which could not be performed in a continuous state space $\cS$. Moreover, they rely on the knowledge of the model ($\Ps$, $\R$, $\constraint$), and do not address the question of learning from interaction data.


\section*{Chapter Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
\glsxtrlongpl{BMDP} are a principled framework for safe decision making under uncertainty, which could be beneficial to the diffusion of Reinforcement Learning in industrial applications. They formulate risk as an expected cumulative cost, which can be estimated and controlled in a model-free fashion. However, \glspl{BMDP} could so far only be solved in finite state spaces which limits their interest for \glsxtrlong{AD} applications that require dealing with continuous variables such as vehicle positions. We extend their scope to continuous states by introducing a novel \glsxtrlong{DP} operator, that we build upon to propose a \glsxtrlong{RL} algorithm. In order to scale to large problems, we provide an efficient implementation that exploits the structure of the value function and leverages tools from Deep Distributed \glsxtrlong{RL}. We show that on two simulated tasks our solution performs similarly to a baseline Lagrangian relaxation method while only requiring a single model to train, and relying on an interpretable risk budget $\budget$ instead of the tedious tuning of the penalty $\lambda$.

A previous result on the stability of triangular systems is generalised to the case of uniform ultimate boundedness of controlled triangular systems. This is used to prove the stability of the overall closed-loop system. The uncertain system with appropriately chosen sliding mode control is shown to be ultimately bounded if the zero dynamics of the nominal system are uniformly asymptotically (exponentially) stable. The design method is demonstrated with two examples.},

The proposed approach can deal with both input and output constraints, as well as measurement noise and output disturbances. The adaptive controller consists of an iterative set membership identification algorithm, that provides a set of candidate plant models at each time step, and a model predictive controller, that enforces input and output constraints for all the plants inside the model set. The algorithm relies only on the solution of standard convex optimization problems that are guaranteed to be recursively feasible. The experimental results obtained by applying the proposed controller to a quad-tank testbed are presented."

  abstract = 	 {Thompson sampling (TS) is an effective approach to trade off exploration and exploration in reinforcement learning. Despite its empirical success and recent advances, its theoretical analysis is often limited to the Bayesian setting, finite state-action spaces, or finite-horizon problems. In this paper, we study an instance of TS in the challenging setting of the infinite-horizon linear quadratic (LQ) control, which models problems with continuous state-action variables, linear dynamics, and quadratic cost. In particular, we analyze the regret in the frequentist sense (i.e., for a fixed unknown environment) in one-dimensional systems. We derive the first $O(\sqrt{T})$ frequentist regret bound for this problem, thus significantly improving the $O(T^{2/3})$ bound of Abeille & Lazaric (2017) and matching the frequentist performance derived by Abbasi-Yadkori & Szepesvári (2011) for an optimistic approach and the Bayesian result Ouyang et al. (2017) We obtain this result by developing a novel bound on the regret due to policy switches, which holds for LQ systems of any dimensionality and it allows updating the parameters and the policy at each step, thus overcoming previous limitations due to lazy updates. Finally, we report numerical simulations supporting the conjecture that our result extends to multi-dimensional systems.}

	abstract={This paper addresses the optimal control problem known as the linear quadratic regulator in the case when the dynamics are unknown. We propose a multistage procedure, called Coarse-ID control, that estimates a model from a few experimental trials, estimates the error in that model with respect to the truth, and then designs a controller using both the model and uncertainty estimate. Our technique uses contemporary tools from random matrix theory to bound the error in the estimation procedure. We also employ a recently developed approach to control synthesis called System Level Synthesis that enables robust control design by solving a quasi-convex optimization problem. We provide end-to-end bounds on the relative error in control cost that are optimal in the number of parameters and that highlight salient properties of the system to be controlled such as closed-loop sensitivity and optimal control magnitude. We show experimentally that the Coarse-ID approach enables efficient computation of a stabilizing controller in regimes where simple control schemes that do not take the model uncertainty into account fail to stabilize the true system.},

A robust LQR is proposed in this paper not only to stabilize the pendulum in upright position but also to make the cart system to track the given reference signal even in the presence of disturbance. The control scheme of pendulum system consists of two controllers such as swing up controller and stabilizing controller. The main focus of this work is on the design of stabilizing controller which can accommodate the disturbance present in the system in the form of wind force. An optimal LQR controller with well tuned weighting matrices is implemented to stabilize the pendulum in the vertical position. The steady state and dynamic characteristics of the proposed controller are investigated by conducting experiments on benchmark linear inverted pendulum system. Experimental results prove that the proposed LQR controller can guarantee the inverted pendulum a faster and smoother stabilizing process with less oscillation and better robustness than a Full State Feedback (FSF) controller by pole placement approach."

Robust optimization is very useful for practice, since it is tailored to the information at hand, and it leads to computationally tractable formulations. It is therefore remarkable that real-life applications of robust optimization are still lagging behind; there is much more potential for real-life applications than has been exploited hitherto. The aim of this paper is to help practitioners to understand robust optimization and to successfully apply it in practice. We provide a brief introduction to robust optimization, and also describe important do׳s and don׳ts for using it in practice. We use many small examples to illustrate our discussions."

An important advantage of this type of control is its ability to cope with hard constraints on controls and states. It has, therefore, been widely applied in petro-chemical and related industries where satisfaction of constraints is particularly important because efficiency demands operating points on or close to the boundary of the set of admissible states and controls. In this review, we focus on model predictive control of constrained systems, both linear and nonlinear and discuss only briefly model predictive control of unconstrained nonlinear and/or time-varying systems. We concentrate our attention on research dealing with stability and optimality; in these areas the subject has developed, in our opinion, to a stage where it has achieved sufficient maturity to warrant the active interest of researchers in nonlinear control. We distill from an extensive literature essential principles that ensure stability and use these to present a concise characterization of most of the model predictive controllers that have been proposed in the literature. In some cases the finite horizon optimal control problem solved on-line is exactly equivalent to the same problem with an infinite horizon; in other cases it is equivalent to a modified infinite horizon optimal control problem. In both situations, known advantages of infinite horizon optimal control accrue."

Such methods are required when—as it often happens in practice—the model involves quantities such as expectations and probabilities that cannot be evaluated exactly. While estimation procedures via sampling are well studied in statistics, the use of such methods in an optimization context creates new challenges such as ensuring convergence of optimal solutions and optimal values, testing optimality conditions, choosing appropriate sample sizes to balance the effort between optimization and estimation, and many other issues. Much work has been done in the literature to address these questions. The purpose of this paper is to give an overview of some of that work, with the goal of introducing the topic to students and researchers and providing a practical guide for someone who needs to solve a stochastic optimization problem with sampling."

This paper presents an approach for the estimation of uncertain linear positive systems, based on interval observers. The provided conditions for the existence of robust interval positive observers are expressed in terms of LP. Also, it is shown that the design of tight interval positive observers can be done by minimizing an adequate bound on the steady state of the interval error. An illustrative example is given."

More precisely, cooperative models are considered, i.e., models that satisfy some constraints on the signs of the entries of the Jacobian of their dynamic equation. In this context, interval observers and a guaranteed recursive state estimation algorithm are combined to enclose the state at any given instant of time in a subpaving. The approach is illustrated on the state estimation of a waste-water treatment process.},

These observers are an extension of the open loop asymptotic observers (observers with unknown inputs) devoted to biotechnological systems for which some parts of the model are unknown. We take benefit of the additional outputs which are (nonlinear) functions of the state to design a closed loop observer. The global convergence of these nonlinear observers is proven. We use these observers to design interval based observers which predict guaranteed intervals in which the state is lying. We run simultaneously a broad set of interval observers and we select the best ones. The method is illustrated with a model describing the bioconversion of a substrate using micro-organisms in a bioreactor."

* Read the [**pdf** file](https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-03035705) (for display on a screen :computer:);
* or the [print version](http://www.edouardleurent.com/pdf/phd-thesis-print.pdf) (for printing on paper :book:).

## Defense

I defended on the 30th of October 2020, in front of the jury composed of:

* Lucian Bu≈üoniu
* Jorge Villagra
* Luce Brotcorne
* Marc Deisenroth
* Denis Efimov
* Odalric-Ambrym Maillard

The slides :newspaper: that I used are also [available online](https://eleurent.github.io/phd-defense/), and [open-source](https://github.com/eleurent/phd-defense).


## How to build the PDF?

I recommend using [latexmk](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/latexmk/) to build this project.

```latexmk -pdf PhD_thesis__Edouard_Leurent.tex```

It is used _e.g._ in the [latex-action](https://github.com/xu-cheng/latex-action) of the automatic [build workflow](/.github/workflows/main.yml).
LaTeX editors such as [Texstudio](https://www.texstudio.org/) can be configured to use latexmk as the default compiler.
